globalThis has no index signature TS Error

In the upcoming lecture (and later with the ticketing, orders and payments services) you may end up seeing a TS error like this in your test/setup.ts file:

Element implicitly has an 'any' type because type 'typeof globalThis' has no index signature.ts(7017)

To fix, find the following lines of code in src/test/setup.ts:

    declare global {
      namespace NodeJS {
        export interface Global {
          signin(): Promise<string[]>;
        }
      }
    }

change to:

        declare global {
          var signin: () => Promise<string[]>;
        }
